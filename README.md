# Android Beans

A dependency injection library for Android apps, that aims for two goals:
- **Power** - Provide the full power of dynamic dependency injection at runtime to allow e.g. injection of all implementations of a certain interface or injecting our custom implementation into another library.
- **Simplicity** - Allow users to define and inject their beans straight forward without the need for too complex structures as e.g. the components, modules and scopes seen with [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/).

In addition Android Beans provides convenient **Java Support** - even though it is written in Kotlin.
